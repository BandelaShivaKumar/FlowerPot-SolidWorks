## 📌 Project Description

This project features the artistic modeling of a **FlowerPot** using the **Flex Command** in **SolidWorks 2025**. The design incorporates flowing organic shapes and advanced features like revolve, sweep, circular patterning, shell, fillets, and flex deformation to simulate a handcrafted pottery look.

The aim was to explore surface manipulation, decorative form design, and real-world flexibility applications.

## ✨ Key Features

- Complex 3D geometry modeled from basic sketches
- Use of `Flex` feature to achieve curvature and twist
- Shell and Fillet operations for realistic thin-walled design
- Patterned surface details using `Circular Pattern`
- Visually rich rendering-style model for 3D printing or visualization

## 📂 File Structure

- `FlowerPot_Flex.SLDPRT` – Main SolidWorks part file

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `FlowerPot_Flex.SLDPRT` in **SolidWorks 2020 or newer**.
2. Check the feature tree to understand the sequence:
   - `Revolve` → `Sweep` → `Pattern` → `Shell` → `Flex`
3. Adjust Flex parameters (e.g., twist, bend) to see how the shape changes.
4. Use **Appearance settings** to render in various finishes or export for 3D printing.
